# Classification
This repository contains my first attempt at image classification using machine learning. The goal of the model is to accurately classify common articles of clothing. The purpose of this project was to further my understanding of how machine learning models are made and to get me thinking about how I could potentially apply it in other useful areas.

## Technology 
ML technologies used in this project:
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Numpy

## Installation
